# Vencord-Plugins-For-Discord
This repository contains a list of Vencord Plugins and themes that I use to enhance my Discord experience.

> **⚠️ Note:** Vencord is technically against Discord's Terms of Service (ToS). However, based on my calculations, there are no known cases of users being banned solely for using Vencord. Use it at your own risk.

## 🚀 My Recommended Plugins
These are the plugins I currently have enabled in my setup. You can find these by searching in **Settings > Vencord > Plugins**.

| Plugin Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **FakeNitro** | Unlocks Nitro-only features: send custom emojis/stickers and stream in high quality for free. |
| **FakeProfileThemes** | Allows you to use custom profile colors and themes without Nitro. |
| **Decor** | Lets you use and see custom avatar decorations (profile borders). |
| **SilentTyping** | Completely hides the "is typing..." indicator so others can't see when you are writing. |
| **VoiceMessages** | Adds the ability to send voice messages from your PC/Browser, which is normally mobile-only. |
| **NoTrack** | Disables Discord's background telemetry and tracking for better privacy. |
| **NoBlockedMessages** | Fully removes the "Blocked Message" placeholder so you never see messages from blocked users. |
| **BetterGifAltText** | Improves the way GIF descriptions are handled for a better browsing experience. |
| **iLoveSpam** | A utility plugin for managing specific chat interactions. |

## ❓ FAQ
**Q: Will I get banned?** A: It is very unlikely. Discord generally does not ban users for client mods unless they are used for malicious purposes.

**Q: Does it work on Mobile?** A: No, Vencord is for Desktop (Windows, Mac, Linux) and Web Browsers only.

**Q: How do I update it?** A: Vencord usually updates itself. If it breaks after a Discord update, just run the installer again and click **Repair**.
